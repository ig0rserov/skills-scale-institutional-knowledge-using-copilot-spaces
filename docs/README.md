# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This collection of guides describes how OctoAcme runs projects, from initial idea through to retrospective and continuous improvement.

## Project Management Processes (Summary)

OctoAcme uses an evidence-driven, iterative process to manage projects from conception through delivery and beyond. Our approach emphasizes **clarity**, **accountability**, and **role alignment** to ensure successful project outcomes. We achieve this through:

### Core Principles

- **Customer-first focus**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Clear ownership and accountability**: Each project has named owners for every critical function—from product definition to quality, infrastructure, and stakeholder management
- **Role clarity and alignment**: Well-defined roles with explicit responsibilities ensure team members understand their contributions and how they interact with others
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to enable rapid feedback
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

### Why Clarity and Accountability Matter

By clearly defining roles and responsibilities, OctoAcme ensures:
- **Reduced ambiguity**: Everyone knows who is responsible for what, minimizing gaps and overlaps
- **Faster decision-making**: Clear ownership enables quick, confident decisions
- **Better collaboration**: Understanding role interactions promotes effective teamwork
- **Improved outcomes**: Accountability drives quality, timeliness, and stakeholder satisfaction

### Project Lifecycle

Projects flow through these key stages:

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, stakeholders, and high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Establish scope, resources, milestones, and dependencies
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate on deliverables
4. **Release**: Deploy, verify, and announce new capabilities
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings and identify next steps

Throughout the lifecycle, we maintain regular communication cadences including weekly PM/PdM syncs, team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates.
